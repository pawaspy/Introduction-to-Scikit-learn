# Scikit-Learn Code Snippets 📝

Welcome to our guide on using scikit-learn! 🎉

## Importing Scikit-Learn 📦

First, we need to import the necessary libraries. For this guide, we'll only need numpy and scikit-learn.

python import numpy as np from sklearn import datasets


## Loading the Dataset 🗄️

Next, let's load a dataset. We'll use the Heart disease and car sales dataset, which is a popular dataset for machine learning beginners.


## Data Preprocessing 🔬

Before we can use our data, we need to do some preprocessing. This usually involves splitting the data into features and target variables, and then splitting the data into a training set and a test set.


## Training the Model 🏋️

Now we can train our model. For this example, we'll use a simple decision tree classifier.


## Making Predictions 🔮

Finally, we can use our trained model to make predictions on the test set.


And that's it! You've just trained a machine learning model using scikit-learn. 🎊
